# Welcome to LinksHub 👋

LinksHub is a Hub of Links `For Developers By Developers`. Here, we've gathered a collection of all the best and most useful resources, both free and paid, to aid in the development journey.

We recognize that there's a wealth of information available, but often, it's a matter of knowing where to find it. That's why we've made it our mission to bring the right resources to the right developers.

## Getting Started 👩‍💻

> ⚠️Prerequisites
>
> - Before getting into it, make sure you have [pnpm](https://nodejs.org/download) installed.
>
> - Also, make sure to follow the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Let's jump right in🌟

1. [Fork](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/fork) the project
2. Clone the project to run on your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/LinksHub.git
   ```

3. Get into the root directory

   ```sh
   cd LinksHub
   ```

4. Install all dependencies by running

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Create your branch

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
   ```

6. Run and view the application on localhost

   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

> **P.S**: If you have `docker` installed in your system, you can follow these steps to set up the environment:
> 1. After forking and cloning the repo(as mentioned above), get into the project directory:
> ```bash
> cd LinksHub/
> ```
> 2. Start the docker container with:
> ```bash 
> docker-compose up
> ```
> 3. Now start adding your changes.
> **Note:** You don't need to restart the container again and again after starting it once, because the changes you make will reflect in the container instantly.

7. Make your changes before staging them.

8. Stage your changes

   ```sh
   git add <filename>
   ```

9. Commit your changes
